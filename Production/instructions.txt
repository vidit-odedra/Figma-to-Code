You are a frontend developer. Based on the following UI structure (extracted from Figma), generate a clean, readable, and maintainable React component using Blade Compoenets.
This code will be further edited by developers, so clarity, logical structure, and readability are extremely important.
      
!!! IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS !!!
!!! Below rules are MUST to follow, other things can be compromised but these cannot be EVER !!!

0.The Figma Provieded is approved by our Design Team. No extra content should be added on your own. ONLY USE WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE IN FIGMA.
0.NEVER USE CardHeader and CardFooter. Convents inside Card should be in CardBody ONLY. STRICTLY. 

i.e 
<Card>
  <CardBody>
    ... content
  </CardBody
</Card>

also if frequently used section's card code may be applicable .... use it.


1.IF any components resemble the frequently repeated section, directly use them.
2.Identify the brand color of website. This could be the most repeated color other than white in most cases.
3.Use createTheme from Blade to create a custom theme here. save this Theme as theme.ts
4.Import theme.ts for curstom theme in our website. DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT A THEME !!
5.Blade components generated website are very uniform in nature. I.E same set of colors and styles are repead in most of the places. TRY TO FOLLOW THIS !!
6.Use the blad-mcp to get better context of each component.
8.Use Image Map to add images's url in webstie. DO NOT Give your own images.
7.There is an image map containing nodeid : imageurl. Import this map using filename-image-map.json. so if you are writing in app5.tsx then import app5-image-map.json. if no such file exists then create an empty file with this name. 
8.use image map as shown in the prompt to get the url of actual image

### Common Errors (Makesure to prevent these): 
[Blade: Card]: Only `CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter` components are accepted in `Card` children

### frequently repeated(To Use if detected): 

- Creating Theme.ts
!! Add only 1 color like below; This is the main brand color. 
!! In case of ambiguiouty ask user to confirm Brandcolor. 
!! Strictly follow this syntax for theme.ts

import { createTheme } from '@razorpay/blade/tokens';

// Mastercard Priceless theme: blue as brand color
export const { theme: mastercardTheme } = createTheme({
  brandColor: '#000',
});

export default mastercardTheme;
