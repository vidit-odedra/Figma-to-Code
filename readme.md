# Figma-to-Code

**Figma-to-Code** is a tool that takes a Figma file URL and generates corresponding React code. It automates the front-end creation process by interpreting Figma design elements and transforming them into clean, usable components.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains two folders:

### 1. `Generate_IRS/`
- A **proof-of-concept** implementation written in **JavaScript**.
- Focuses on testing out the core ideas.
- May contain errors due to the lack of strict typing and error handling.

### 2. `Production/`
- A **production-ready version** built with **TypeScript**.
- Implements strong type checking and robust error handling.
- Generates cleaner and more reliable React code.
- For a detailed explanation of the agent's inner workings, see the `README.md` inside the `Production/` folder.

Feel free to explore both versions to understand the development process from prototype to production.
